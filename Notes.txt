Ordinal regression is much like multinomial regression in order.
Thumb rule: Train accuracy must be more than test accuracy.
Overfitting  - The difference between train and test accuracy is greater than 5%
Underfitting -  Both train and test accuracy is less, it's underfitting
Rightfit     - The difference between train and test accuracy is less than 5%
Analogy: Take umberella analogy
solver="newton-cg" - is standard backend kind of algorithm just like makimum likelihood

Advanced regression:
Possion distribution is extenstion of negative binomial distribution
space = length, area and volume
Poisson distribution range is from zero to infinity

Binomial, negative binomial and poisson distributions
